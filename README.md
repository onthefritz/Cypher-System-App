# Cypher System Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## What does it do?

This app was built with the intention of easing character creation within the Cypher System TTRPG game created by [Monte Cook Games](https://www.montecookgames.com/). I initially built it for an off shoot of the Cypher System that I built that changes a few things within Character Creation but decided to allow for the base game to work as well.

When you download the creator from the [Releases](https://github.com/onthefritz/Cypher-System-App/releases) channel you will be able to pick up either a Windows or Debian version. They are both installers that will install the creator. 

The Windows version uses [Squirrel](https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers/squirrel.windows) for instillation which is supposed to be a no wizard installer but it does have a small green window popup that just kind of sits there for a few minutes during the install process.

If any bugs are noted, please feel free to let me know and when I get time I will work on trying to resolve them. This is a personal project that I made for myself and I'm not front end designer so it's not beautiful but it works.
